# Algorithm Implementations: Knapsack, Bubble Sort, and SystemTick

This repository contains implementations of the **Knapsack Problem**, **Bubble Sort**, and a performance comparison between **Bubble Sort** and **Merge Sort**. The project includes recursive and iterative solutions for the Knapsack Problem, as well as a system tick-based implementation to evaluate sorting algorithm performance.
